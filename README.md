# file-editor

A thought experiment in node.js.
Express app and middleware for image processing

## To do list
- add file extension to uploaded file
- add api to convert file to black and white
- add api to resize image to a bunch of different sizes
- store image meta data / state in flat file
-  Jslint
- jsHint
- harness to upload and process multiple files ( jmeter script ?)
- look at sencajs framework to see how to pipeline all image processing tasks
